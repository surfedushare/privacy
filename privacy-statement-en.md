### What personal data do we use and why?
Educational institutions that fall within SURFnet's target group were given the opportunity to take part in the Edubadges pilot.

1) To detect software errors and be able to help users that run in to problems.
2) To prevent and track down abuse of the SURF searchportal systems.

These personal data are processed exclusively for these purposes within the context of the pilot SURF searchportal for open educational resources. The legal basis for processing these personal data is legitimate interest.
